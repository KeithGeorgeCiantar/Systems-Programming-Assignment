# Custom Linux Shell (Eggshell) Project

This is the assignment for CPS1012 (Operating Systems and Systems Programming 1).

The aim of this work is to create a custom shell with specific internal commands, that can also run standard commands. The full specification is quite broad, but the main focus points are: custom fancy printing, handling environment variables, running external commands, and piping.
